**-Introduction**

**-What is Shell**

A shell is a command-line interpreter, it is the computer program that provides a user interface to access the services of the operating system. Depending on the type of interface they use, shells can be of various types, in this case, a shell program of the type sh (Bourne Shell) will be developed. Users typically interact with a shell using a terminal emulator that is used for entering data into and displaying or printing data from, a computer or a computing system.
**-What is it for**

This consists of interpreting orders. It incorporates features such as process control, input/output redirection, law listing and reading, protection, communications, and a command language for writing batch programs or scripts. All Unix-type systems have at least one interpreter compatible with the Bourne shell. The Bourne shell program is found within the Unix file hierarchy at /bin/sh.

    Task 0. README, man, AUTHORS
    Task 1. Betty would be proud
    Task 2. Simple shell 0.1
    Task 3. Simple shell 0.2
    Task 4. Simple shell 0.3
    Task 5. Simple shell 0.4
    Task 6. Simple shell 1.0
    Task 7. What happens when you type ls -l in the shell

**-General requirements**

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    No more than 5 functions per file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    This shell should not have any memory leaks
    Unless specified otherwise, your program must have the exact same output as sh (/bin/sh) as well as the exact same error output.

**-Allowed functions used**

    execve (man 2 execve)
    exit (man 3 exit)
    _exit (man 2 _exit)
    fork (man 2 fork)
    free (man 3 free)
    getline (man 3 getline)
    isatty (man 3 isatty)
    malloc (man 3 malloc)
    perror(man 3 perror)
    signal (man 2 signal)
    stat (__ xstat) (man 2 stat)
    strtok (man 3 strtok)
    wait (man 2 wait)
    write (man 2 write)

**Compilation**

**Your shell will be compiled this way:**

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh`
**Testing**

**Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:**
```javascript
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
**But also in non-interactive mode:**
```javascript
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
